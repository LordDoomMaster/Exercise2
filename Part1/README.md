### What is a semaphore?
> A semaphore is a kind of flag which is used to signal whether a function or set of code is available or already in use. Binary - 1 or 0, counting - increments when joined, and decrements when left.

### What is a critical section?
> A critical section is the part of a program which accesses shared resources.
